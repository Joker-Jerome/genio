Description: The 'genio' (GenIO = Genetics I/O) package implements simple parsers and writers for tables associated with statistical genetics data.  The key functions are wrappers for readr functions that are more constrained, user-friendly, and efficient for these particular applications.  Currently handles plink and eigenstrat tables (.fam, .bim, .ind files).
