Description: The 'genio' (GenIO = Genetics I/O) package implements simple parsers and writers for tables associated with statistical genetics data.  A lightning-fast plink-format BED writer is provided.  Other functions are `readr` wrappers that are more constrained, user-friendly, and efficient for these particular applications; handles plink and eigenstrat tables (FAM, BIM, IND, and SNP files).  There are also "make" functions for FAM and BIM tables with default values to go with simulated genotype data.
